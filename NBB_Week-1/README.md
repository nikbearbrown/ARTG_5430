# Week-1-assignment

Create a choropleth map for every US county using Geo Albers projection, with the column '% Change in Mortality Rate, 1980-2014' in the file data/mort.csv for the category 'cardiovascular diseases'. If you feel ambitious, please go ahead and make multiple maps for different categories.

_It would be preferable, if you use a different color scheme from the one we used in the class._

Please feel free to export a smaller csv file using R or whatever tools you find more comfortable, in order to reduce the file size. You are also encouraged to aesthetically improve the page with usage of better fonts and colors.
