        <h1>Percent Change in Mortality Rate, 1980-2014 by County</h1>
   
        <P>I was having a lot of issues with the county data so I changed the return value to a very dark grey  <pre>return '#43464B';.</pre>.
            At first I thought a lot of data was missing and I could not visually tell the difference between the middle of my color gradient and
            a light grey. So many light grey counties on the map is due to so many counties being in the middle of the spectrum (light grey).
            Not due to missing data.
        </p>
        

        <p>I also tried a  percent change in mortality rate, 1980-2014 by county using d3.geoAlbersUsa() in the file <a href="index_usa_counties.html">index_usa_counties.html</a> </p>
