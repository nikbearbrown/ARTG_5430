        <h1>Percent Change in Mortality Rate, 1980-2014 by State</h1>
        <P>I was having a lot of issues with the county data so I simplified the problem a bit to first show the percent change in mortality rate, 1980-2014 by state.</p>
        
        <p>I will try a  percent change in mortality rate, 1980-2014 by county in the file <a href="index_counties.html">index_counties.html</a> </p>
